<p>"It's a project that uses html and css to build a web page for a barbershop."</p>

<h2>first part</h2>

<p>
Created first part of index.html file and style.css
</p>


<h2>Second part</h2>

<p>
We created another CSS called products and inside it, all the configuration of our page, we reviewed the usefulness of the header, how to create a division inside the header, how to put an image as the main content in your title, create a navigation menu with links between pages.
</p>
<p>
We create the main content of the page and a list of items, complex items with item, with title, with image, with description text, with text to be the price of the item. Also, we created our footer, put an image and a background image in our footer.
</p>
<p>
We create a Copyright text and use a unicode. In our CSS, we reinforced the padding and border text, we reinforced the creation of background colors and text colors. We learned to center content, using the automatic margin, we learned to position the element on our page, with relative and absolute position.
</p>
<p>
We even tinkered with how to make the text uppercase, and how to remove the underline from the text of a link. We played with how to transform an element into a percentage size, how to set the margin in percentage, how to set the element's content to behave according to the width in percentage that we created.
</p>
<p>
We still create a border, round the corner of the border, change the behavior of elements with hover and active. Finally, we changed our footer, putting a background image automatically repeated and always changing the font size and text size.
</p>

<h2>Third Part</h2>

<p>
We created the complete contact page. We created a complex form, a table with opening hours from a page that did not exist. We copied the header and footer from the previous page and created the entire contents of this contact page.
</p>

<p>
On the contact page our header was imported, even so we improved the accessibility of our image by creating an alternative for it. We created all our form inside our main, and we saw the form tag, the label tag, the input tag, the types of input that exist. How do we create the relationship between a label and an input.
</p>

<p>
We use the classes again, we understand how to make an input mandatory. How to leave an example text in the input. How to create a box for the user to write a text. How to still create good semantics within the form with the fieldset and the legend. How to create a type, a selection of various options within our form. How to use the checkbox, input of type radio. How to create a button, and we still style this button
</p>

<p>
Finally, we created an extremely semantic table, with all the appropriate content to have this perfect code. In our CSS we still had the creation of all the style of the table with the tags we learned, and all the style of the form. Also learning how to create a duplication of the same style for two elements, how to move the entire form, we reinforced the use of the display block, we reinforced the use of fonts and spacing. And we still learned in CSS how to create transitions and transformations in our elements.
