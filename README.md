<p>"It's a project that uses html and css to build a web page for a barbershop."</p>

<h2>first part</h2>

<p>
Created first part of index.html file and style.css
</p>


<h2>Second part</h2>

<p>
We created another CSS called products and inside it, all the configuration of our page, we reviewed the usefulness of the header, how to create a division inside the header, how to put an image as the main content in your title, create a navigation menu with links between pages.
</p>
<p>
We create the main content of the page and a list of items, complex items with item, with title, with image, with description text, with text to be the price of the item. Also, we created our footer, put an image and a background image in our footer.
</p>
<p>
We create a Copyright text and use a unicode. In our CSS, we reinforced the padding and border text, we reinforced the creation of background colors and text colors. We learned to center content, using the automatic margin, we learned to position the element on our page, with relative and absolute position.
</p>
<p>
We even tinkered with how to make the text uppercase, and how to remove the underline from the text of a link. We played with how to transform an element into a percentage size, how to set the margin in percentage, how to set the element's content to behave according to the width in percentage that we created.
</p>
<p>
We still create a border, round the corner of the border, change the behavior of elements with hover and active. Finally, we changed our footer, putting a background image automatically repeated and always changing the font size and text size.
